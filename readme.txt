Title: School (Lycee) Maze Game
Authors: Anneli, Merili

Description: You have to escape the school (maze) but its hallways have been scrambeled. Aand it's dark! 
(secret: On your way out, Mr Pedak will block the way and ask an important question. If you don't know the answer
you will have to go study, and if you do, you can proceed.)
1) Show the UI, empty;
2) The start button is pressed, show instructions;
3) Show maze for a bit (fade-in, fade-out);
4) The player can move using buttons on the top, button, left and right side of the maze, or with arrow 
keys; The visuals are toggleable with a button, to ensure that the game is playable on the phone; with the button
"light a match", the player can make a png of the map visible, the function can be used three times;
5) When encountering Pedak, the question pops up in a modal; the player answers a 3-choice question; 
6) When a question is answered wrong, show visual and after a short wait, send them to study;
7)The game ends when the player reaches the end or answers a question wrong.

ADDENDUM: the visuals should show when: a step is taken, a wall is hit, Pedak is encountered (gif-->png-->gif), 
the exit is found.
All the gifs should be removed when they are about to loop (or around that period).
